# üèπ Legolas' Last Stand
Legolas' Last Stand is an original idea influenced by the popular arcade game "Alien Invasion."
I created this game by following the "Python Crash Course" book and the result is my attempt.  

## ‚öî Introduction
> In Legolas' Last Stand, the player controls Legolas himself who appears at
the bottom center of the screen. The player can move Legolas
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot arrows using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a horde of orcs fills advance upon Legolas
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the orcs. If the player shoots all the orcs, a fresh horde
appears that moves faster than the previous horde. If any orcs hits
Legolas  or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a life. If the player loses three lives, the game ends.
